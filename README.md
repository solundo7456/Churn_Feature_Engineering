# Churn_Feature_Engineering
Transforming raw data into features that better capture the patterns that lead to churn
This project focuses on feature engineering and data transformation techniques used to improve the performance of a customer churn prediction model for PowerCo.

The goal is to transform raw data — including dates, categorical variables, and skewed numeric features — into meaningful, model-ready features that can reveal important customer behaviors such as loyalty, engagement, and churn risk.
